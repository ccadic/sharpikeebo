Hello all.
This is the SHARPIKEEBO Nano Computer shield, built around the famous Raspberry PI Zero 2W , the high quality SHARP Mempory Display (400x240 pixels),
a QMK Firmware (https://docs.qmk.fm/#/) USB keyboard based on an ATMEGA32U4 uC with a true mini PC keyboard.

This tool has been designed to help system administrators have a nice very little tool to ssh to a server and perform administration operations. 
During the creation process, many users told us it could also be a nice game station.

The SHARPIKEEBO will be sold fulled assembled. We plan to start a www.crowdsupply.com crowd funding campaign for this.

The SHARPIKEEBO carrier board has been designed to hold both a Raspberry(R) PI ZERO 2W or W + 2.7"  (400x240) Sharp Memory Display. This display is capable of a fast refresh which allows the use of linux shells or display game images. A true USB Keyboard (driven by QMK firmware, so fully customized) has been added on the board.

The board also has 4 independently controllable LEDs you can switch on/off with classic GPIO commands (C++ or Python)

The board also has 5 buttons you may also control via GPIO voltage detection (UP/Down voltage detection).  You can use this board for gaming.

And more, you have UART GPIO and I2C GPIO easily available on board should you want to add a 3.3v or 5v module such a GPS , 4g or 5g modem etc ...

The board + RPI can be powered thought a USB C connector.  The board has also been design to behave as a USB keyboard you can plug on a desktop or laptop or rack server.
