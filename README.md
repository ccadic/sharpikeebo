# sharpikeebo V1.1
Miniature RPI Zero 2W shield with Sharp memory Display and USB Beyboard

Hello all.
This is the SHARPIKEEBO Nano Computer shield, built around the famous Raspberry PI Zero 2W , the high quality SHARP Mempory Display (400x240 pixels),
a QMK Firmware (https://docs.qmk.fm/#/) USB keyboard based on an ATMEGA32U4 uC with a true mini PC keyboard.

This tool has been designed to help system administrators have a nice very little tool to ssh to a server and perform administration operations. 
During the creation process, many users told us it could also be a nice game station.

The SHARPIKEEBO will be sold fulled assembled. We plan to start a www.crowdsupply.com crowd funding campaign for this.
